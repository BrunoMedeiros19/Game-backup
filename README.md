# **Ping Pong** :ping_pong:	

This game was inspired by the famous game called "**Pong**". I used Unity to make my version of the game. :smile:

## **Game Description**

Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 5 points, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. The game can be played with two human players where they need to press the **`W`**, **`S`**, **`UP-ARROW`** and **`DOWN-ARROW`** to be able to move the padlers!

## **Features**
